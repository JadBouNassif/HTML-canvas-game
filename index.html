            Welcome to AimFreaks, the premier destination for gamers seeking to
            elevate their shooting skills and dominate the virtual
            battlegrounds. Gridshot is more than just a game mode; it's a
            dynamic training exercise designed to challenge your reflexes,
            sharpen your precision, and boost your target acquisition skills. In
            Gridshot, you'll face a relentless barrage of targets, with three
            balls appearing at a time. Your task is simple yet demanding: shoot
            one, and another instantly takes its place. This continuous stream
            of targets keeps you on your toes and pushes you to the limits of
            your shooting abilities.
